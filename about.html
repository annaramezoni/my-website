                <p class="presentation__about-me__paragraph">I'm originally from Brazil, where I graduated in French Letters at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte in 2017. Between 2014 and 2018,  I worked as an English teacher, a role that helped me develop strong communication skills and a love for learning. </p>

                <p class="presentation__about-me__paragraph">In 2019, I moved to New Zealand and have embraced a variety of roles since then. My longest experience was as a kiwifruit orchard supervisor. Currently, I work as a fruit monitoring technician, and I'm also diving into a new chapter—studying programming and exploring new career opportunities in tech. </p>

                <p class="presentation__about-me__paragraph">Outside of work and study, I’m passionate about music, staying active at the gym, and enjoying nature—especially going to the beach and snorkeling during vacations. In my free time, I also love relaxing with a good anime series. </p>

                <p class="presentation__about-me__paragraph">I'm always curious and open to learning new things, whether it’s a new skill, language, or experience! </p>
